3. Donor completes payment → Gateway sends webhook
4. System verifies signature → Updates donation status
5. Triggers post-payment: receipt generation, notifications, accounting

### Multi-Tenant Support
- Subdomain-based tenant isolation
- Tenant-specific data segregation
- Shared codebase with tenant context
- Configurable via MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED flag

### Security Layers
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Webhook signature verification
- Audit trail for sensitive actions
- File upload MIME validation
- Role-based access control
